            <h3>What do we do inside the vehicle?</h3>
            <p> Wverything, I mean everything!</p>
            <p> A car detailing company's interior services focus on thoroughly cleaning and restoring the vehicle's interior to its best condition. These services typically include vacuuming seats, carpets, and mats to remove dirt and debris, as well as deep cleaning and shampooing to eliminate stains and odors. Hard surfaces such as dashboards, door panels, and consoles are wiped down, conditioned, and polished to restore their original luster while protecting them from cracking and fading. Specialized attention is given to crevices and vents to remove dust and grime, ensuring a meticulous finish. Glass surfaces, including windows and mirrors, are cleaned streak-free for optimal clarity. Some companies may also offer additional treatments like leather conditioning, fabric protection, and odor removal to enhance and preserve the interior's appearance and comfort.</p>
