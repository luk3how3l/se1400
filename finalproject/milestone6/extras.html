                    <p>As a Division 1 long-distance runner, I compete in both track and cross country events. The discipline and dedication required for these sports have taught me valuable lessons in time management, perseverance, and balancing athletic performance with academic excellence. Training at this level requires a deep commitment to both physical and mental preparation.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            "People are often unreasonable, illogical and self centered;
                            Forgive them anyway.
                            
                            If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives;
                            Be kind anyway.
                            
                            If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies;
                            Succeed anyway.
                            
                            If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you;
                            Be honest and frank anyway.
                            
                            What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight;
                            Build anyway.
                            
                            If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous;
                            Be happy anyway.
                            
                            The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow;
                            Do good anyway.
                            
                            Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough;
                            Give the world the best you've got anyway.
                            
                            You see, in the final analysis, it is between you and your God;
                            It was never between you and them anyway." -Mother Teresa
